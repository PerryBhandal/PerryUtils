To mount via your public key first add the key to the target server's authorized_keys, then run this on the mounting client. It should auto reconnect on connection loss.

sudo umount -l 70
sshfs -o reconnect,ServerAliveInterval=15,ServerAliveCountMax=3,IdentityFile=/home/perry/.ssh/id_rsa deluge@198.154.103.70:/home/deluge/ 70
