** Install necessary components

Do a sys wide installation of guard-livereload (sudo gem install guard):

sudo gem install guard-livereload

Install the LiveReload plugin in Chromium: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en

** Prep the project for LiveReload

In the pyjs root dir run "guard init livereload"

Go into the Guardfile and add the following to the bottom (well, after everything but 'end'):

watch(%r{static/.+\.html})
watch(%r{static/.+\.css})

** Start up guard

In the root dir call guard. It'll list errors, ignore them -- still works.

** Get compilation/server watcher running

run sniffer for auto rebuilds

run the rpc_server

** Issues

Currently does double refresh on changes to any file, but that's not a big deal.
