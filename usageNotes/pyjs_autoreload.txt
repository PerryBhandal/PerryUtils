run sniffer for auto rebuilds

run the rpc_server

Access the static/application.html file in FF.

Now each time a SCSS/HTML file changes it's going to auto reload in FF. (**HAS TO BE FF**)

== TODO ==

In the auto reload FF plugin use autoreload in order to make get requests hit the rpc server (as opposed to being run locally).
