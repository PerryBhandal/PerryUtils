Starting everything up

First open Eclipse, then go "Show view --> other --> eclimd console"

This will begun running the eclim daemon.

You can now launch vim normally. Type :PingEclim to verify that it can connect.

Window Layout:

The easiest way I've found so far is to put eclipse on the workspace to the left and set it to "always on visible workspace."

Then in your main workspace just align Vim so it's on top of Eclipse, and set it to "always on top."

When you want to use eclipse, just swap to left workspace.
