General workflow
--
**Projects**
Except for very basic projects, create a Sublime project for everything. Eases project specific config settings. Keep it your repo as well.

**Snippets**
To use snippets just type the keyword in and then press tab. For example, here are a few useful snippets:

def tab (adds the end, and prompts for method name).

Be aggressive about adding new snippets.

Default
---
Command Palette: ctrl + shift + p (menu, package commands, etc)
File dropdown: ctrl + p (use this to load files)
Goto symbols: ctrl + r (can type symbol names here to navigate them).
Go to line by number: ctrl + g, then enter number.
ctrl + # - Switches to a specific viewport (e.g. ctrl+1 for left, ctrl + 2 for right).
ctrl + alt + # - Puts in that many workspaces.

Personal binds

Look at the keybinds file to see these.
