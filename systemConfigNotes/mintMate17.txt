Set up git projects to work on SSD

When installing, make sure you allocate your system in a way so that your SSD only has / and swap.

Once installation is done, as root make a folder /workSSD  . (Note that's in the root dir of the system).
Now chown that folder to perry: chown -R perry:perry /workSSD

Now any time you want something on your SSD, you can just place it there and symlink it into your home. (e.g. git projects, etc).

===
Install flux

Download the 64 bit verison that supports multiple monitors

http://justgetflux.com/linux.html

Install it by unraring it and putting it into /usr/bin

====
Get multi-monitors working

Use the AMD drivers. The open-source AMD (fglrx, or something to that effect) ones have fan issues. 

You'll also need to set scaling to 15% overscale for your two monitors connected via dvi (hdmi --> dvi, that is).

You need to first configure the monitors (for overscan, and being a multi-monitor setup) in amdcccle, then reboot, then go into monitors in Mate and make sure you don't have "same image on all monitors" checked.
===
Add multiple panels

Set the top panel to unlocked on whatever monitor it's on, then you can move it, and re-expand it. Then right click on an area not covered by a plugin, and create 2 new panels for your left and right monitors, respectively.
===
Add printer:

Use this make and model: Brother HL-2170W Foomatic/lj4dith

NOTE: Do NOT use the generic driver it auto-recommends. Makes the printer incredibly slow.
