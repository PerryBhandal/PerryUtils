Connecting to laptop via VNC gives this error on the viewer:

perry@perry-zenbook ~/work $ vnc_connect
Connected to RFB server, using protocol version 3.8
Enabling TightVNC protocol extensions
No authentication needed
Authentication successful

Do the following (on laptop) to fix the above error.

- Run x11vnc

-Configure the first screen, wait for the second screen then apply that as well.

- Should now have x11vnc in your taskbar, right click it, go into properties and enable "accept connections."

- Now connect on your client.
