Slow connect may be result of TLP's wifi power saving.

See here: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html

Trying now by just editing the value directly in /etc/default/tlp

** Above on its own didn't fix it. Made following modificaiton to tlp default:

RESTORE_DEVICE_STATE_ON_STARTUP=1
