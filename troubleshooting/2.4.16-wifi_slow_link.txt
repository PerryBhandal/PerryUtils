Slow connect may be result of TLP's wifi power saving.

See here: http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html

Trying now by just editing the value directly in /etc/default/tlp

** Above on its own didn't fix it. Made following modificaiton to tlp default:

RESTORE_DEVICE_STATE_ON_STARTUP=1

Above has worked so far. Added it to the set up guide.

5ghz vs 2.4 ghz

Only been using 2.4 ghz for a few minutes but every conect has worked without a wifi reset. Could the problem be isolated to the 5ghz case and not the 2.4ghz case?

2.4 ghz seemed to work, but you're still getting those massive spikes you had when you were previously at 2.4 ghz.

New fix attempt: no longer combining the two 5 ghz radios into a single access point. Using two separate broadcasts on either ends of the channel spectrum (believe ch 36 and ch 149, respectively).

3/13/16: So far, so good! Not having any issues connecting when the radios are split and the secondary radio runs on channel 161 @ 5 ghz.
