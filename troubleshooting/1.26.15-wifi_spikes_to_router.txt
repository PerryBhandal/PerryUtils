SUMMARY

Wifi lag is related to channel. Had it on 11, persisted on 1, disappeared on 6.

1.26.15 -> Channel 6 fixed it.

1.26.15 -> Problems reappeared on channel 6.

Now trying Wide HT40 (20+20 mhz) channel width on channel 11 again.

Extension channel is lower.

That didn't fix it.

1.26.15 -> Reverted t0 2mhz channel width, wireless channel 6.

Changed wireless network mode from Mixed to N-Only.
***
FUTURE

1) Use a channel analyzer when the lag starts, and when the lag isn't occurring.
Is there any difference in how crowded any given channel is? Is there any correlation
between activity and ping spikes?

2) If it's not something that can be fixed on a constant channel, try seeing how tough it is
to switch the channel via ssh on DD-WRT. Band-aid could be to just have a background ping running,
when spikes occur it'll auto switch the channel. This is a messy solution though so avoid it
if possible.

QUESTIONL: Could it be related to TX power?
Answer (1.26.15 -> No. Tx power is constant throughout).

lo        no wireless extensions.

wlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:"perry_24ghz"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.462 GHz  Access Point: E8:FC:AF:F5:6D:4B   
          Bit Rate=78 Mb/s   Tx-Power=16 dBm   
          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off

          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0

The above is iwconfig whilee lag was occurring. This was a really bad instance of lag:

Persisted even after a reboot. I was on channel 11, now trying a switch to channel 1.

Persisted even after switching to channel 1.

Trying to reboot my laptop now.

Even after reboot it's still lagging.

Trying to switch to wifi channel 6 now.

**** SWITCHING TO CHANNEL 6 FIXED IT ***

Trying to see if switching to channel 1 now causes it to return.

Switching back to channel 1 *DID* cause it to return.

Then switching back to channel 6 resolved it again.
