PerryUtils
==========

This repo is where I place utilties I've written to make myself more productive/efficient.

For the most part there won't be much documentation as I doubt too many other people will find them particularly useful! That being said, I've included some minimal documentation in the header of each file. 

In the off chance someone happens to stumble across this repo, feel free to ping me if you have any questions.
