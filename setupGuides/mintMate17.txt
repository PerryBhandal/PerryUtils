#### Laptop Global #####
##########################

Disable battery notifications

When you do the mate-notification-daemon changes that are listed above it's going to start showing alerts as regular windows whenever you unplug/plug in on your laptop. To fix that you need to

- Install dconf-editor

- Go into org > mate > power-manager. Ensure the following are not checked:

notify-discharging, notify-low-capacity, notify-low-power, notify-sleep-failed


==

Install new power manager (tlp):

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw; sudo tlp start

Still has significant benefit, even on the UX305 (got down to ~3.2 watts from 4.8).

===
Add laptop specific packages

apt-get install xbacklight
===
Prevent auto screen dimming

Go into power options.
==
Add laptop specific hotkeys:

alt + f1 - xbacklight -set 12 [Dim screen]
==
Set sleep options

No dimming on each.

On active power:

never place it to sleep, and when the laptop lid is closed suspend. Should not spin down hard disks.
Set display to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes. Sets display brightness to 15%.

On battery:

Never put computer to sleep when inactive. When laptop lid is closed standby. When critically low power, hibernate.
Check spin down hard disk swhen possible.
Put display to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes.
Set display brightness to 15% (this prevents the random insta fully bright problem).

==
rc.local (set screen brightness). Add following to rc.local

chmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
echo 15 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness

==
Fix Mouse vert scrolling

Open mouse app and set scrolling to two-finger scrolling

===

Add battery monitor

Set existing battery monitor to never show an icon.
 
Add the battery monitor applet using the "add to panel" area.

Set the battery monitor applet to be compact view, show time/percentage, show tim eremaining, warn at 15%.
===

Fonts and sizes

- Set font DPI to 110 in appearnce/fonts/details. Still need to see if this will scale up in all applications, whether menu will fit post reboot, and how to up font size in Firefox.

- Set Chromium's default zoom (advanced settings) to 110%.

##### Zenbook ##############
###########################

Use this as your info source instead of the launchpad page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ASUS_Zenbook_UX303 <-- Refers to the same model family as your system.

TODO: Do you need to use 2.4 ghz or 5.0 ghz at home? 5 is having slow connects. How about 2.4, are you still getting the spikes?

TODO: Should I disable BT on start?

TODO: Do I need any additional power managemnt tools like tlp, laptop mode tools etc? Can get 4.1 watt idle with stock 3.19.

Good source for info: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbook

TODO : Needa  better solution for touchpad hits while typing -- touchpad is huge on this thing. Maybe look into disable touchpad on type if you can avoid the big delay it previously had.

PROBLEMS:

1) Right click via tap is a bit of a pain. Any way to make it more responsive?

QUESTIONS:

1) Do I need to do the SSD instructions? Seems odd to recommend those changes for all zenbooks when their hardware can vary so drastically. Go without it for now.

===
Fix touchpad:

Install focaltech dkms

https://github.com/hanipouspilot/focaltech-dkms

Got a copy of the repo stored ni setupGuides/zenbook. Note that it says it's just for 3.19. Once you go past 3.19 figure out whether you should still install it.

To install it go into setupGuides/zenbook, run dkms add ./focaltech-dkms

Now go into the focaltech-dkms folder and run 'sudo dkms add .'

Now run sudo dkms install -m focaltech -v 1.5

Now reboot, once you go back into mouse the touchpad option should now be visible.

==
Set synclient for touchpad

synclient MaxSpeed=1
synclient AccelFactor=0.15

Set up git projects to work on SSD

When installing, make sure you allocate your system in a way so that your SSD only has / and swap.

Once installation is done, as root make a folder /workSSD  . (Note that's in the root dir of the system).
Now chown that folder to perry: chown -R perry:perry /workSSD

Now any time you want something on your SSD, you can just place it there and symlink it into your home. (e.g. git projects, etc).


====
Get multi-monitors working

NOTE: This was modified on 12/24/14. I'm now using fglrx, seems fine on the fan stuff. I was getting issues with the catalyst ones causing window rendering to be slow when running Chrome. Not sure what was causing it, but for now fglrx seems to resolve it (presumably means AMD closed drivers had something to do with it).

Use the AMD drivers. The open-source AMD (fglrx, or something to that effect) ones have fan issues. 

You'll also need to set scaling to 15% overscale for your two monitors connected via dvi (hdmi --> dvi, that is).

You need to first configure the monitors (for overscan, and being a multi-monitor setup) in amdcccle, then reboot, then go into monitors in Mate and make sure you don't have "same image on all monitors" checked.
===
Add multiple panels

Set the top panel to unlocked on whatever monitor it's on, then you can move it, and re-expand it. Then right click on an area not covered by a plugin, and create 2 new panels for your left and right monitors, respectively.
===
Add printer:

Use this make and model: Brother HL-2170W Foomatic/lj4dith

NOTE: Do NOT use the generic driver it auto-recommends. Makes the printer incredibly slow.
