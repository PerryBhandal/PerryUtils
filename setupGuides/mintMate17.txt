Have to do this via PPA as default repos have a very old version:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install SQLiteBrowser

======
Set up gnome-do

Remove alt + f2 keybinding from central key binds.
Set alt + f2 in gnome-do.
Make gnome-do run on start, and hide first notification.

==
Set up pencil

The repo version doesn't work for exporting to single page. You need to compile it yourself and run it as a Firefox extension.

Here's the repo: https://github.com/prikhi/pencil

Pull the most recent tagged version. Run

cd build
./build.sh xpi
firefox Outputs/Pencil*.xpi

This'll open up firefox with the install prompt, click okay. Install finishes.

Add it to the main bar by hitting the options button, select customize, drag Pencil into that menu bar.

Once done, add the Bootstrap stencils:

https://github.com/nathanielw/Bootstrap-Pencil-Stencils

The way you install this is to download the repo. It's going to contain everything within a single named folder. Zip up everything within that named folder (but not the naemd folder itself, so it'll have icons, etc) and then you can hit tools > import collection and select the zip you created.

TODO: Fix this so you can do it standalone, rather than relying on FF.

Leave firefox installed though. You can set chromium as default in menu > preferences > preferred applications.
==
Create a private key and authorize it with GitHub:

Generate key: "ssh-keygen -t rsa" -- CREATE A PASSPHRASE! Your distro keyring will store it, so you won't need to enter it every time. 
Add the key to our ssh agent: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Copy the public key: xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Go into scripts, run copyTo.sh.

Now go into keyboard shortcuts and add the following hotkeys:

If you get anerror on loading wnck module, run:

sudo apt-get install python-wnck

NOTE: This is being done using quicktile now, not your original script

alt + left > /home/perry/.scripts/quicktile/quicktile.py left
Do alt + left, up, down, right and replace the parameter to quicktile with the correct value.

The bindings above will only handle snappings that are vertically maximized. To have it take up 1/4 a screen, use

shift + alt + f1 > /home/perry/.scripts/quicktile/quicktile.py top-left 

Do shift + alt + f1, f2, f3, f4 with values top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right, respectively.

===
Disable battery notifications

When you do the mate-notification-daemon changes that are listed above it's going to start showing alerts as regular windows whenever you unplug/plug in on your laptop. To fix that you need to

- Install dconf-editor

- Go into org > mate > power-manager. Ensure the following are not checked:

notify-discharging, notify-low-capacity, notify-low-power, notify-sleep-failed
====

Fix wifi connect speed.

Answer from here:http://askubuntu.com/questions/119578/how-to-fix-slow-wireless-on-machines-with-intel-wireless-cards

Solution is to run

sudo gvim gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi-disable11n.conf

In there put options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1

Reboot.

===
Add laptop specific packages

apt-get install xbacklight
===
Prevent auto screen dimming

Go into power options.
==
Add laptop specific hotkeys:

alt + f1 - xbacklight -set 12 [Dim screen]
==
Set sleep options

No dimming on each.

On active power:

never place it to sleep, and when the laptop lid is closed suspend. Should not spin down hard disks.
Set display to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes. Sets display brightness to 15%.

On battery:

Never put computer to sleep when inactive. When laptop lid is closed standby. When critically low power, hibernate.
Check spin down hard disk swhen possible.
Put display to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes.
Set display brightness to 15% (this prevents the random insta fully bright problem).


====
Install new power manager (tlp):

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw; sudo tlp start

===

Add battery monitor

Set existing battery monitor to never show an icon.
 
Add the battery monitor applet using the "add to panel" area.

Set the battery monitor applet to be compact view, show time/percentage, show tim eremaining, warn at 15%.

===

Fonts and sizes

- Set font DPI to 110 in appearnce/fonts/details. Still need to see if this will scale up in all applications, whether menu will fit post reboot, and how to up font size in Firefox.

- Set Chromium's default zoom (advanced settings) to 110%.

====

Keyboard backlight

Use fn + space to toggle keyboard backlight.

TESTING: Fix 2.4 ghz wifi problems.

Been having ping spikes even to new Nighthawk router. Issue may be related to Bluetooth as it runs on the same frequency (2.4 ghz).

Currently testing fix by blocking bluetooth, do so by adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

blacklist btusb

Doesn't look like the bluetooth disabling helped. Other possible culprits:

**UPDATE: It looks like bluetooth does actually exist on this system. So stick to doing the blacklist btusb stuff above**

Poss 1:

tlp's wifi power on battery

http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html

Look at WIFI_PWR_ON_BAT

Poss 2:

This one was likely just a coincidence, but after installing the linux-firmware package, after rebooting I had fairly stable pings.

SOLUTION 1:

One thing that seems to always work is switching the 2.4 ghz channel on your router.
Usually bounce between channel 1 and 11. Not sure why that fixes it. Should try
rebooting it in the future (on the same channel) and see if that helps. Another
possible solution could be switching to DD-WRT (more a shot in the dark than
anything though).

Set up git projects to work on SSD

When installing, make sure you allocate your system in a way so that your SSD only has / and swap.

Once installation is done, as root make a folder /workSSD  . (Note that's in the root dir of the system).
Now chown that folder to perry: chown -R perry:perry /workSSD

Now any time you want something on your SSD, you can just place it there and symlink it into your home. (e.g. git projects, etc).

===
Install redshift

sudo apt-get install redshift

I like 2750 for night, and 6500 for normal use.

Can specify a color temperature using: redshift -O 2500

^ Above is a O, not a 0.

====
Get multi-monitors working

NOTE: This was modified on 12/24/14. I'm now using fglrx, seems fine on the fan stuff. I was getting issues with the catalyst ones causing window rendering to be slow when running Chrome. Not sure what was causing it, but for now fglrx seems to resolve it (presumably means AMD closed drivers had something to do with it).

Use the AMD drivers. The open-source AMD (fglrx, or something to that effect) ones have fan issues. 

You'll also need to set scaling to 15% overscale for your two monitors connected via dvi (hdmi --> dvi, that is).

You need to first configure the monitors (for overscan, and being a multi-monitor setup) in amdcccle, then reboot, then go into monitors in Mate and make sure you don't have "same image on all monitors" checked.
===
Add multiple panels

Set the top panel to unlocked on whatever monitor it's on, then you can move it, and re-expand it. Then right click on an area not covered by a plugin, and create 2 new panels for your left and right monitors, respectively.
===
Add printer:

Use this make and model: Brother HL-2170W Foomatic/lj4dith

NOTE: Do NOT use the generic driver it auto-recommends. Makes the printer incredibly slow.

Create your perry user

To keep things simple, just make a user named perry. You'll need to switch user each time after a reboot, but it'll keep everything else simple.

So, to do this just add the user perry, but also make sure that you add it to the sudoers file.

To do that you just add the following:

perry ALL=(ALL) ALL

General notes for tensegrity lab:

Do NOT install Spotify. Something related to the spotify package causes the entire persistence volume to throw an IO error on reads. Really bizarre -- seen it twice now.
