==
Vim peripheral packages 

View the setup.txt doc in the vim folder, has more details.
==
Disable popup notifications

This one is messy, no easy way to just purge mate-notificaton-daemon.

For now just run (as root):

chmod 0000 /usr/lib/mate-notification-daemon

Have to reboot after. The problem with this approach is that in some cases programs will give error messages about not being able to start mate-notification-daemon.

To re-enable  notifications can just chmod 755 the file.
===
TODO: 

1) ADD WINDOW SNAPPING (TOP, BOTTOM) AND ASSOCIATED KEYS.
2) Add notification disabling  approach. (Got a basic solution for now, come up with something cleaner).

===
Disable battery notifications

When you do the mate-notification-daemon changes that are listed above it's going to start showing alerts as regular windows whenever you unplug/plug in on your laptop. To fix that you need to

- Install dconf-editor

- Go into org > mate > power-manager. Ensure the following are not checked:

notify-discharging, notify-low-capacity, notify-low-power, notify-sleep-failed
====

Add laptop specific packages

apt-get install xbacklight
===
Prevent auto screen dimming

Go into power options.
==
Add laptop specific hotkeys:

alt + f1 - xbacklight -set 12 [Dim screen]
==
Set sleep options

No dimming on each.

On active power:

never place it to sleep, and when the laptop lid is closed suspend. Should not spin down hard disks.
Set display to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes. Sets display brightness to 15%.

On battery:

Never put computer to sleep when inactive. When laptop lid is closed standby. When critically low power, hibernate.
Check spin down hard disk swhen possible.
Put display to sleep when inactive for 10 minutes.
Set display brightness to 15% (this prevents the random insta fully bright problem).


====
Install new power manager (tlp):

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw; sudo tlp start

==
rc.local (set screen brightness). Add following to rc.local

chmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
echo 15 > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness

==
Fix Mouse vert scrolling

Open mouse app and set scrolling to two-finger scrolling

===

Set resolution to 1920x1080

===

Fix wifi

sudo echo '#added to enable WiFi on Yoga 2 Pro'>>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf; sudo echo 'blacklist ideapad_laptop'>>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

===

Add battery monitor

Set existing battery monitor to never show an icon.
 
Add the battery monitor applet using the "add to panel" area.

Set the battery monitor applet to be compact view, show time/percentage, show tim eremaining, warn at 15%.

===

Fonts and sizes

- Set font DPI to 110 in appearnce/fonts/details. Still need to see if this will scale up in all applications, whether menu will fit post reboot, and how to up font size in Firefox.

- Set Chromium's default zoom (advanced settings) to 110%.

====

Keyboard backlight

Use fn + space to toggle keyboard backlight.

TESTING: Fix 2.4 ghz wifi problems.

Been having ping spikes even to new Nighthawk router. Issue may be related to Bluetooth as it runs on the same frequency (2.4 ghz).

Currently testing fix by blocking bluetooth, do so by adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

blacklist btusb

Doesn't look like the bluetooth disabling helped. Other possible culprits:

**UPDATE: It looks like bluetooth does actually exist on this system. So stick to doing the blacklist btusb stuff above**

Poss 1:

tlp's wifi power on battery

http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html

Look at WIFI_PWR_ON_BAT

Poss 2:

This one was likely just a coincidence, but after installing the linux-firmware package, after rebooting I had fairly stable pings.

SOLUTION 1:

One thing that seems to always work is switching the 2.4 ghz channel on your router.
Usually bounce between channel 1 and 11. Not sure why that fixes it. Should try
rebooting it in the future (on the same channel) and see if that helps. Another
possible solution could be switching to DD-WRT (more a shot in the dark than
anything though).

Now sudo -su

sudo touch /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla

Add the following to that PKLA file

[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]

Set up git projects to work on SSD

When installing, make sure you allocate your system in a way so that your SSD only has / and swap.

Once installation is done, as root make a folder /workSSD  . (Note that's in the root dir of the system).
Now chown that folder to perry: chown -R perry:perry /workSSD

Now any time you want something on your SSD, you can just place it there and symlink it into your home. (e.g. git projects, etc).

===
Install flux

Download the 64 bit verison that supports multiple monitors

http://justgetflux.com/linux.html

Install it by unraring it and putting it into /usr/bin

====
Get multi-monitors working

NOTE: This was modified on 12/24/14. I'm now using fglrx, seems fine on the fan stuff. I was getting issues with the catalyst ones causing window rendering to be slow when running Chrome. Not sure what was causing it, but for now fglrx seems to resolve it (presumably means AMD closed drivers had something to do with it).

Use the AMD drivers. The open-source AMD (fglrx, or something to that effect) ones have fan issues. 

You'll also need to set scaling to 15% overscale for your two monitors connected via dvi (hdmi --> dvi, that is).

You need to first configure the monitors (for overscan, and being a multi-monitor setup) in amdcccle, then reboot, then go into monitors in Mate and make sure you don't have "same image on all monitors" checked.
===
Add multiple panels

Set the top panel to unlocked on whatever monitor it's on, then you can move it, and re-expand it. Then right click on an area not covered by a plugin, and create 2 new panels for your left and right monitors, respectively.
===
Add printer:

Use this make and model: Brother HL-2170W Foomatic/lj4dith

NOTE: Do NOT use the generic driver it auto-recommends. Makes the printer incredibly slow.

====
Create your perry user

To keep things simple, just make a user named perry. You'll need to switch user each time after a reboot, but it'll keep everything else simple.

So, to do this just add the user perry, but also make sure that you add it to the sudoers file.

To do that you just add the following:

perry ALL=(ALL) ALL
====
Mount your local HD to work

Make a symlink from /home/perry to the local HD/PerryTemp

You'll need to manually mount the drive for this step.

ln -s /media/perry/E608409D08406F1D/PerryTemp work

General notes for tensegrity lab:

Do NOT install Spotify. Something related to the spotify package causes the entire persistence volume to throw an IO error on reads. Really bizarre -- seen it twice now.
