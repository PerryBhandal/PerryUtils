notify-discharging, notify-low-capacity, notify-low-power, notify-sleep-failed

Set up git projects to work on SSD

When installing, make sure you allocate your system in a way so that your SSD only has / and swap.

Once installation is done, as root make a folder /workSSD  . (Note that's in the root dir of the system).
Now chown that folder to perry: chown -R perry:perry /workSSD

Now any time you want something on your SSD, you can just place it there and symlink it into your home. (e.g. git projects, etc).


====
Get multi-monitors working

NOTE: This was modified on 12/24/14. I'm now using fglrx, seems fine on the fan stuff. I was getting issues with the catalyst ones causing window rendering to be slow when running Chrome. Not sure what was causing it, but for now fglrx seems to resolve it (presumably means AMD closed drivers had something to do with it).

Use the AMD drivers. The open-source AMD (fglrx, or something to that effect) ones have fan issues. 

You'll also need to set scaling to 15% overscale for your two monitors connected via dvi (hdmi --> dvi, that is).

You need to first configure the monitors (for overscan, and being a multi-monitor setup) in amdcccle, then reboot, then go into monitors in Mate and make sure you don't have "same image on all monitors" checked.
===
Add multiple panels

Set the top panel to unlocked on whatever monitor it's on, then you can move it, and re-expand it. Then right click on an area not covered by a plugin, and create 2 new panels for your left and right monitors, respectively.
===
Add printer:

Use this make and model: Brother HL-2170W Foomatic/lj4dith

NOTE: Do NOT use the generic driver it auto-recommends. Makes the printer incredibly slow.
