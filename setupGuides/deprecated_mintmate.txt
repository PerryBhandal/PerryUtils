### From GLOBAL

=====

Install SQLiteBrowser.

Have to do this via PPA as default repos have a very old version:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install SQLiteBrowser


==
==
Set up pencil

The repo version doesn't work for exporting to single page. You need to compile it yourself and run it as a Firefox extension.

Here's the repo: https://github.com/prikhi/pencil

Pull the most recent tagged version. Run

cd build
./build.sh xpi
firefox Outputs/Pencil*.xpi

This'll open up firefox with the install prompt, click okay. Install finishes.

Add it to the main bar by hitting the options button, select customize, drag Pencil into that menu bar.

Once done, add the Bootstrap stencils:

https://github.com/nathanielw/Bootstrap-Pencil-Stencils

The way you install this is to download the repo. It's going to contain everything within a single named folder. Zip up everything within that named folder (but not the naemd folder itself, so it'll have icons, etc) and then you can hit tools > import collection and select the zip you created.

TODO: Fix this so you can do it standalone, rather than relying on FF.

Fix wifi connect speed.

Answer from here:http://askubuntu.com/questions/119578/how-to-fix-slow-wireless-on-machines-with-intel-wireless-cards

Solution is to run

sudo gvim gedit /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi-disable11n.conf

In there put options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1

Reboot.

TESTING: Fix 2.4 ghz wifi problems.

Been having ping spikes even to new Nighthawk router. Issue may be related to Bluetooth as it runs on the same frequency (2.4 ghz).

Currently testing fix by blocking bluetooth, do so by adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

blacklist btusb

Doesn't look like the bluetooth disabling helped. Other possible culprits:

**UPDATE: It looks like bluetooth does actually exist on this system. So stick to doing the blacklist btusb stuff above**

Poss 1:

tlp's wifi power on battery

http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html

Look at WIFI_PWR_ON_BAT

Poss 2:

This one was likely just a coincidence, but after installing the linux-firmware package, after rebooting I had fairly stable pings.

SOLUTION 1:

One thing that seems to always work is switching the 2.4 ghz channel on your router.
Usually bounce between channel 1 and 11. Not sure why that fixes it. Should try
rebooting it in the future (on the same channel) and see if that helps. Another
possible solution could be switching to DD-WRT (more a shot in the dark than
anything though).

Install TuxOnIce from the PPA:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tuxonice/ppa; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install tuxonice-userui linux-generic-tuxonice linux-headers-generic-tuxonice; sudo ln -s /usr/lib/tuxonice-userui/tuxoniceui /usr/local/sbin/tuxoniceui_text

Now sudo -su

sudo touch /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.enable-hibernate.pkla

Add the following to that PKLA file

[Re-enable hibernate by default in upower]
Identity=unix-user:*

Install new power manager (tlp):

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw; sudo tlp start

==
rc.local (Blacklist usb, disable discharging notifications and disable the power button).

rfkill block bluetooth
blacklist btusb
gsettings set org.mate.power-manager notify-discharging false
gsettings set org.mate.power-manager button-power nothing

NOTE: The above gsettings stuff isn't working properly, look at the next command in the meantime.

==
Disable webcam

Add the following to rc.local

modprobe -r uvcvideo

==

Fix power settings

Go into gsettings and search for org.mate.power-manager, set:

notify-discharing to false
button-power to nothing

TODO: Change this eventually so it's done via the command line in rc.local (above)

Make a persistent Linux Mint Mate USB key

====
Create your perry user

To keep things simple, just make a user named perry. You'll need to switch user each time after a reboot, but it'll keep everything else simple.

So, to do this just add the user perry, but also make sure that you add it to the sudoers file.

To do that you just add the following:

perry ALL=(ALL) ALL
====
Mount your local HD to work

Make a symlink from /home/perry to the local HD/PerryTemp

You'll need to manually mount the drive for this step.

ln -s /media/perry/E608409D08406F1D/PerryTemp work

General notes for tensegrity lab:

Do NOT install Spotify. Something related to the spotify package causes the entire persistence volume to throw an IO error on reads. Really bizarre -- seen it twice now.
