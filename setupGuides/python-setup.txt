Install other versions of Python (3.5, what else?)

http://askubuntu.com/questions/682869/how-do-i-install-newer-python-versions-using-apt-get

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install python3.5 python3.5-dev
----
Install pudb and vim-pudb.

Can use vim one to set breakpoint, then run them in pudb itself. Both on pip.

----

Install sniffer for automatic test running. (Need pip for this).

Disable the annoying notifications by patching out the broadcaster call:

sudo sed --in-place=.bak -r 's/(broadcaster.success)/pass #\1/g' /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sniffer/runner.py; sudo sed --in-place=.bak -r 's/(broadcaster.failure)/pass #\1/g' /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sniffer/runner.py

Checking

Install mypy, pyflakes and pylint globally.

For mypy and pylint be sure to get them from their git repos:

https://github.com/python/mypy

https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint

The current version of mypy is throwing an error from an assert, you can just comment that out.

Ensure all installs are done using python3 (keep none of the above installed on Python 2 to avoid using Py2 linters on Py3 code).

For debugging use pudb and ipdb.

pudb has a decent terminal 'graphical' interface. It gives you the big picture.
ipdb is just plain text.

Can install both with pip.

Here's a breakdown comparing them:

Install mypy

Recall that mypy needs python3. Use the following (ensure it's not in a venv):

sudo pip3 install mypy-lang typing

Getting eralchemy working

Use eralchemy for generating ER diagrams from SQLAlchemy or a standalone db.

First install graphviz-dev via apt, then use pip to install pygraphviz and eralchemy.
