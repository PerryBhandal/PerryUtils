Install sniffer for automatic test running. (Need pip for this).

Disable the annoying notifications by patching out the broadcaster call:

sudo sed --in-place=.bak -r 's/(broadcaster.success)/#\1/g' /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sniffer/runner.py; sudo sed --in-place=.bak -r 's/(broadcaster.failure)/#\1/g' /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sniffer/runner.py

Install pyflakes as well.

For debugging use pudb and ipdb.

pudb has a decent terminal 'graphical' interface. It gives you the big picture.
ipdb is just plain text.

Can install both with pip.

Here's a breakdown comparing them:
