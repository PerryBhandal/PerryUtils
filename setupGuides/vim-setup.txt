**** Compile vim from source

https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source

Few notes about this:
- In step 3, do everything EXCLUDING make VIMRUNTIMEDIR (and beyond). You'll do checkinstall there.
- Use checkinstall instead of make (so replace sudo make install with sudo checkinstall).
- Do not do any of the update-alternatives stuff and beyond. The above handles setting up gvim and vim, and you can handle file associations on a per-extension basis.

** *** Install Vundle plugin manager

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

**** Install YCM auto completion

1) Ensure development tools and cmake are installed (sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake)
2) Have python headers installed (sudo apt-get install python-dev)
3) Compile with support for C languages:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.sh --clang-completer

Note: You'll want to have a default .ycm_extra_conf.py that's stored in ~ so that you don't get pesky messages about YCM not having a config file even for projects you don't want YCM active for. copyTo.sh copies the default one that's stored in this folder.

*** Language specific packages

Add javascript auto completion

Ensure npm and nodejs are installed.

Do plugininstall (to install ternjs/tern_for_vim', then go to ~/.vim/bundle/tern and run npm install. This will install tern.

Ensure that within your folder you have a .tern-project file, here's one for a node app:

{
	"libs":["jquery", "browser"],

	"plugins": {
	"node": {}
	}

}

Here is a more complete tern project file

{
  "defs": [
    "browser",
    "ecma5",
    "ecma6"
  ]
}

Add javascript linting/hinting

Run sudo npm install -g jshint

Should work with syntastic right out of the box.
