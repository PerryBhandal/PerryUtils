**** Compile vim from source

https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source

Few notes about this:
- In step 3, do everything EXCLUDING make VIMRUNTIMEDIR (and beyond). You'll do checkinstall there.
- Use checkinstall instead of make (so replace sudo make install with sudo checkinstall).
- Do not do any of the update-alternatives stuff and beyond. The above handles setting up gvim and vim, and you can handle file associations on a per-extension basis.

** *** Install Vundle plugin manager

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

**** Install YCM auto completion

1) Ensure development tools and cmake are installed (sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake)
2) Have python headers installed (sudo apt-get install python-dev)
3) Compile with support for C languages:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.sh --clang-completer

Note: You'll want to have a default .ycm_extra_conf.py that's stored in ~ so that you don't get pesky messages about YCM not having a config file even for projects you don't want YCM active for. copyTo.sh copies the default one that's stored in this folder.

*** Language specific packages

Add javascript auto completion

Don't recall the exact order I did this in. I know it's some combo of the steps below (but not all of them potentially, try it sequentially and after each change check if ac works)

Ensure npm and nodejs are installed.

Do plugininstall (to install ternjs/tern_for_vim', then go to ~/.vim/bundle/tern and run npm install. This will install tern.

Right now I have "autocmd FileType javascript setlocal omnifunc=tern#Complete" in my .vimrc. Should move that to the ftplugin for js eventually.

Check now whether it works. If it doesn't you should go into ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe and run ./install.py --clang-completer --tern-completer

For above instruction, see a bit down in YCM's readme.

Now again check if it works.

Ensure that within your folder you have a .tern-project file, here's one for a node app:

{
	"libs":["jquery", "browser"],

	"plugins": {
	"node": {}
	}

}

Add javascript linting/hinting

Run sudo npm install -g jshint

Should work with syntastic right out of the box.
