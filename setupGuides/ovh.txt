Using additional IPs in KVM on Proxmox (may not apply to LXC):

- Create a virtual mac address for the IP

- Create the container, ensure you use the virtual mac address is set as the interface's mac address during creation.

- In set up use the netmask provided in the extra IP e-mail.

- Use the gateway from your block (not the main server's gateway as the instructions mention).

Migrating openVZ to LXC and updating network config.

1) Run a backup then pull the lzo to ovh.

2) Restore the save: pct restore 103 vzdump-openvz-103-2017_03_14-03_19_34.tar.lzo

In the above replace 103 with the desired node id and the lzo to the system you want to restore.

3) Generate a virtual mac address and bind the desired IP to it (do this via cpanel [right click ip, make virtual mac])

4) Add the ip (via proxmox's network ui, not directly to interfaces) with the following settings:

name: eth0

MAC Address: Set this to your virtual MAC

IPV4 static, 149.56.34.x/29 , replace x with last octet
Gateway is 149.56.34.126 [*NOT* the root system's ip with 254 as the last octet [ovh suggests this])

5) Start the container now.

6) Can enter the container to debug using pct enter 103 (node id) from the host.
