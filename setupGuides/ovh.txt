Using additional IPs in KVM on Proxmox (may not apply to LXC):

- Create a virtual mac address for the IP

- Create the container, ensure you use the virtual mac address is set as the interface's mac address during creation.

- In set up use the netmask provided in the extra IP e-mail.

- Use the gateway from your block (not the main server's gateway as the instructions mention).

IPV4 static, 149.56.34.x/29 , replace x with last octet
Gateway is 149.56.34.126 [*NOT* the root system's ip with 254 as the last octet [ovh suggests this])
Netmask is 255.255.255.248

Migrating openVZ to LXC and updating network config.

1) Run a backup then pull the lzo to ovh.

2) Restore the save: pct restore 103 vzdump-openvz-103-2017_03_14-03_19_34.tar.lzo

In the above replace 103 with the desired node id and the lzo to the system you want to restore.

3) Generate a virtual mac address and bind the desired IP to it (do this via cpanel [right click ip, make virtual mac])

4) Add the ip (via proxmox's network ui, not directly to interfaces) with the following settings:

name: eth0

MAC Address: Set this to your virtual MAC

IPV4 static, 149.56.34.x/29 , replace x with last octet
Gateway is 149.56.34.126 [*NOT* the root system's ip with 254 as the last octet [ovh suggests this])
Netmask is 255.255.255.248

5) Start the container now.

6) Can enter the container to debug using pct enter 103 (node id) from the host.

Calculator:

http://ipcalc.nmonitoring.com/?zmena=5&ip1=158&ip2=690&ip3=130&ip4=224&netmask=0&mask_bits=27&max_subnets=0&max_addresses=0

Network address:	158.178.130.224 / 28
Usable IP addresses:	158.178.130.225 - 158.178.130.238
Broadcast:	158.178.130.239

FOr instance, when using 158.69.139.225 here were the network device settigns:

Name eth0
Mac address (the one bound to 225)
bridge: vmbr0
No vlan tag, rate limite or firewall.

IPv4 is set to static with IPv$ set to 158.69.139.225/28 and the gateway set to 158.69.139.238

For some reason entering the gateway as 58.69.139.238 makes it work... Why?!

IPMI:

To run IPMI add OVH's KVM IP to your Java exceptions list (open Java Config, this isn't done in browser). The IP to add to exceptions is "http://142.4.221.0"
