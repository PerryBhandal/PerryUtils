Using additional IPs in KVM on Proxmox (may not apply to LXC):

- Create a virtual mac address for the IP

- Create the container, ensure you use the virtual mac address is set as the interface's mac address during creation.

- In set up use the netmask provided in the extra IP e-mail.

- Use the gateway from your block (not the main server's gateway as the instructions mention).
