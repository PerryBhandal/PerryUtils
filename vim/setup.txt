**** Compile vim from source

https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source

Few notes about this:
- In step 3, do everything EXCLUDING make VIMRUNTIMEDIR (and beyond). You'll do checkinstall there.
- Use checkinstall instead of make (so replace sudo make install with sudo checkinstall).
- Do not do any of the update-alternatives stuff and beyond. The above handles setting up gvim and vim, and you can handle file associations on a per-extension basis.

** *** Install Vundle plugin manager

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

**** Install YCM auto completion

1) Ensure development tools and cmake are installed (sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake)
2) Have python headers installed (sudo apt-get install python-dev)
3) Compile with support for C languages:

cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.sh --clang-completer

Note: You'll want to have a default .ycm_extra_conf.py that's stored in ~ so that you don't get pesky messages about YCM not having a config file even for projects you don't want YCM active for. copyTo.sh copies the default one that's stored in this folder.

*** Language specific packages

C/C++
