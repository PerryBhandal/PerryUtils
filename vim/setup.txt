**** Compile vim from source

https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source

Few notes about this:
- In step 3, do everything EXCLUDING make VIMRUNTIMEDIR (and beyond). You'll do checkinstall there.
- Use checkinstall instead of make (so replace sudo make install with sudo checkinstall).
- Do not do any of the update-alternatives stuff and beyond. The above handles setting up gvim and vim, and you can handle file associations on a per-extension basis.
