Install dosfstools so you can do mkfs.vfat

pacman -S dosfstools; mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<DRIVE HERE>

==

mount -a remounts fstab.

Ensure your EFI system partition is not over 512 megs. You have to manually add it into your FSTAB using its partid. Get it from blkid.

***Remounting/prepping when re-entering installer**

mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi

pacman -S grub; grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --boot-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB

drive layout:

efi: 512mb. Alias uefi.
swap: 64 gigs. Alias swap. +64G.
all remaining space to /. Determine that using F in fdisk. Alias linux.

Ethernet:

On new desktop, the ethernet controller is e1000e. 00:1f.6.

If you reenter the installer, you need to use arch-chroot to remount your install:

First you need to mount your root partition to /mnt and your swap is on:

mount /dev/<partition> /mnt
swapon /dev/<swap par> # Don't have to do this if you don't want.

Then run

arch-chroot /mnt

Missing packages in your install initially:

dhcpcd

===

Networking:

Initially you need to enable and start the dhpccd yourself

systemctl enable dhcpcd@enp0s31f6 (or whatever the id is from your dmesg | grep e***)



Then do systemctl start ( systemctl start dhcpcd@enp0s31f6 . It'll now run on every reboot.

(Also seems you can find it in 'ip link', it lists the identifier on the left.
