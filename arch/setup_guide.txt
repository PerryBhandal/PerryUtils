Missing packages

sudo

Problems
==

Install dosfstools so you can do mkfs.vfat

pacman -S dosfstools; mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<DRIVE HERE>

==

mount -a remounts fstab.

Ensure your EFI system partition is not over 512 megs. You have to manually add it into your FSTAB using its partid. Get it from blkid.

==** Config sudo and create user **==

Uncomment the sudo group line in /etc/sudoers

Create your user and add a home directory:

useradd -m perry

passwd perry

usermod -aG sudo perry

***Remounting/prepping when re-entering installer**

mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi

pacman -S grub; grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --boot-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB

==

drive layout:

efi: 512mb. Alias uefi.
swap: 64 gigs. Alias swap. +64G.
all remaining space to /. You just press enter during drive creation to use all remaining space, don't need to look it up. Default partition type is fine.

==

Ethernet:

On new desktop, the ethernet controller is e1000e. 00:1f.6.

Found this using lspci -v | grep Ethernet

Could e1000e-dkms solve it?

If you reenter the installer, you need to use arch-chroot to remount your install:

First you need to mount your root partition to /mnt and your swap is on:

mount /dev/<partition> /mnt
swapon /dev/<swap par> # Don't have to do this if you don't want.

Then run

arch-chroot /mnt

==

Missing packages in your install initially:

dhcpcd

===

Networking:

Initially you need to enable and start the dhpccd yourself

systemctl enable dhcpcd@enp0s31f6 (or whatever the id is from your dmesg | grep e***)



Then do systemctl start ( systemctl start dhcpcd@enp0s31f6 . It'll now run on every reboot.

(Also seems you can find it in 'ip link', it lists the identifier on the left.

user interface

Ensure you have your locale set or terminal won't open.

Use sudo visudo or you'll get write issues.

pacman -S grub efibootmgr; mkdir /boot/efi; mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi; grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=GRUB --efi-directory=/boot/efi; grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

**DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT**

https://www.tecmint.com/install-mate-desktop-in-arch-linux/

Once booted in, you need to:

2) Set up a keybind for terminal. Go into terminal and set your color scheme to white on black.
3) pacman -S kupfer
4) Setup your hotkeys

	ctrl + alt + t > launch terminal

Create your user, then add yourself to sudoers.

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-users-in-linux-using-the-useradd-command/

useradd --create-home perry
passwd perry
sudo usermod -aG wheel perry
Uncomment out wheel in /etc/sudoers (this gives wheel group sudo permissions, perry inherits from that).

Reboot after doing this before logging in.
