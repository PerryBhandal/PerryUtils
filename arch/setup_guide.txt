Problems

Install dosfstools so you can do mkfs.vfat

pacman -S dosfstools; mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<DRIVE HERE>

==

mount -a remounts fstab.

Ensure your EFI system partition is not over 512 megs. You have to manually add it into your FSTAB using its partid. Get it from blkid.

***Remounting/prepping when re-entering installer**

mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot/efi

pacman -S grub; grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --boot-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB

==

drive layout:

efi: 512mb. Alias uefi.
swap: 64 gigs. Alias swap. +64G.
all remaining space to /. Determine that using F in fdisk. Alias linux.

==

Ethernet:

On new desktop, the ethernet controller is e1000e. 00:1f.6.

Found this using lspci -v | grep Ethernet

Could e1000e-dkms solve it?

If you reenter the installer, you need to use arch-chroot to remount your install:

First you need to mount your root partition to /mnt and your swap is on:

mount /dev/<partition> /mnt
swapon /dev/<swap par> # Don't have to do this if you don't want.

Then run

arch-chroot /mnt

Missing packages in your install initially:

dhcpcd

===

Networking:

Initially you need to enable and start the dhpccd yourself

systemctl enable dhcpcd@enp0s31f6 (or whatever the id is from your dmesg | grep e***)



Then do systemctl start ( systemctl start dhcpcd@enp0s31f6 . It'll now run on every reboot.

(Also seems you can find it in 'ip link', it lists the identifier on the left.

Ensure you have your locale set or terminal won't open.

Create your user, then add yourself to sudoers.

https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-users-in-linux-using-the-useradd-command/

useradd --create-home perry
passwd perry
sudo usermod -aG wheel perry
Uncomment out wheel in /etc/sudoers (this gives wheel group sudo permissions, perry inherits from that).

Reboot after doing this before logging in.
