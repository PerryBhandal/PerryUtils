Install dosfstools so you can do mkfs.vfat

pacman -S dosfstools; mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/<DRIVE HERE>

mount -a remounts fstab.

Ensure your EFI system partition is not over 512 megs. You have to manually add it into your FSTAB using its partid. Get it from blkid.

Ethernet:

On new desktop, the ethernet controller is e1000e. 00:1f.6.

Found this using lspci -v | grep Ethernet

Could e1000e-dkms solve it?

If you reenter the installer, you need to use arch-chroot to remount your install:

arch-chroot /mnt
